What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need
to do it?

In order to initialize a new repository in the folder desired
you should type git init which will create a new repository, but
it will not create any commit yet.


How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is somewhere between the working directory and
the repository, the idea is to collect all the files to be
included in a commit before the commit is created. The command
git add is used for that end.
